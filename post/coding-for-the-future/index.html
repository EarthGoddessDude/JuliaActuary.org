Companies like Prudential, MetLife, and others partnered with technology companies in the development of hardware and software<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fndef:2" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup>. The dramatic embodiment of this information-driven cycle was portrayed in the infamous Billion Dollar Bubble movie, which uses the power and abstraction of the computer to commit millions of dollars of fraud by creating and maintaining fake insurance policies.</p> <p>The movie also starts to hint at the oscillation away from the technological-competitive focus of insurance companies. I argue that the focus on technology was lost over the last 50 years with the rise of Wall Street finance, investment-oriented life insurance, industry consolidation, and explosion of financial structuring like derivatives, reserve financing, or advanced forms of reinsurance. Value-add came from the C-Suite, not from the underlying business processes, operations, and analysis. The result is why ever-more complicated reinsurance treaties are layered into mainframes and admin systems older than most of the actuaries interfacing with them.</p> <p>The reversion to value-creation through technology has begun and is evident across many traditional sectors. Tesla claims it&#39;s a technology company; Amazon is the #1 product retailer because of its internal focus on information sharing between its internal teams<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fndef:3" class=fnref >[3]</a></sup>; Airlines are so dependent on their systems that the skies become quieter on the rare occasion that their computers give way. </p> <p>Why is it, that company&#39;s that are so involved in <em>things</em> &#40;cars, shopping&#41; and <em>physical services</em> &#40;flights&#41; are so much more focused on improving their technological focus than insurance companies <em>whose very focus is &#39;information-based&#39;</em>? <strong>The market has rewarded those who have prioritized their internal technological solutions.</strong></p> <p>Commoditized investing services and low yield environments have reduced insurance companies&#39; comparative advantage to &quot;manage money&quot;. Yield compression and the explosion of consumer-oriented investment services means a more competitive focus on the ability to manage the entire policy lifecycle efficiently &#40;digitally&#41;, perform more real-time analysis of experience and risk management, and handle the growing product and regulatory complexity. These are problems that have technological solutions and are waiting for insurance company adoption.</p> <p>Companies that treat data like coordinates on a grid &#40;spreadsheets&#41; <em>will get left behind</em>. Two main hurdles that have prevented technology companies from breaking into insurance - high regulatory barriers to entry and figuring out how to sell complex, value-added insurance products without traditional distribution. Once those two walls are breached, traditional insurance companies without a strong technology core will struggle to keep up. It&#39;s not just adding &quot;developers&quot; to an organization - it&#39;s going to be <strong>getting domain experts like actuaries to be an integral part of the technology transformation.</strong></p> <h3 id=whats_coding_got_to_do_with_this ><a href="#whats_coding_got_to_do_with_this">What&#39;s coding got to do with this?</a></h3> <p>Everything. Programming is the optimal way to interact between the computer and actuary - and importantly between computer and computer. Programming is the actionable expression of ideas, math, analysis, and information. Think of programming as the 21st-century leap in the Actuary&#39;s toolkit, just as spreadsheets were in the preceding 40 years. <strong>The actuary of the future needs to have coding as one of their core skills.</strong> Already today, the advances of business processes, insurance products, and financial ingenuity are written with lines of code - <em>not</em> spreadsheets. Not being able to code <em>necessarily</em> means that you are <em>following</em> behind what others are doing today.</p> <h3 id=the_coding_actuary ><a href="#the_coding_actuary">The coding Actuary</a></h3> <p>Despite the swing back towards needing to focus on technology, we still haven&#39;t left the finance-driven complexity behind. The business needs are increasingly complex and for that reason, there will be a large productivity difference between an actuary who can code and one who can&#39;t - simply because the former can react, create, synthesize, and model faster than the latter. From the efficiency of transforming administration extracts, summarizing and aggregating valuation output, to analyzing claims data in ways that spreadsheets simply can&#39;t handle, you can become a &quot;<strong>10x Actuary</strong>&quot;<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fndef:4" class=fnref >[4]</a></sup>.</p> <p>Flipping switches in a graphical user interface versus being able to <em>build models</em> is the difference between having a surface-level familiarity and having full command over the analysis and the concepts involved - with the flexibility to do what your software can&#39;t. Your current software might be able to perform the first layer of analysis - but be at a loss when you want to visualize, perform sensitivity analysis, statistics, sensitivities, or stochastic analysis - things that, when done programmatically, are often done with just a few lines of additional code.</p> <p>Do I advocate dropping the license for your software vendor? No, not yet anyway. But the ability to supplement and break out of the modeling box has been an increasingly important part of most actuaries&#39; work.</p> <p>Additionally, code-based solutions can leverage the entire-technology sector&#39;s progress to solve problems that are <em>hard</em> otherwise: version control and versioning, model change governance, reproducibility, scalability, data workflows, integration across functional areas, and more.</p> <p>30-40 years ago, there were no vendor-supplied modeling solutions and so you had no choice but to build models internally. This shifted with the advent of vendor-supplied modeling solutions. Today, it&#39;s never been better for companies to leverage open source to support their custom modeling, risk analysis/monitoring, and reporting workflows.</p> <h3 id=what_about_managersleaders ><a href="#what_about_managersleaders">What about managers/leaders?</a></h3> <p>The ability to understand the concepts, capabilities, challenges, and lingo is not a dichotomy, it&#39;s a spectrum. Most actuaries, even at fairly high levels, are still often involved in analytical work and analysis. Above that, it&#39;s difficult to lead something that you don&#39;t understand.</p> <h1 id=footnotes ><a href="#footnotes">Footnotes</a></h1> <p><table class=fndef id="fndef:1"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:1">[1]</a> <td class=fndef-content ><a href="https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/2472/swp-3575-28521189.pdf?sequence&#61;1">Co-evolution of Information Processing Technology and Use: Interaction Between the Life Insurance and Tabulating Industries</a> </table> <table class=fndef id="fndef:2"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:2">[2]</a> <td class=fndef-content ><a href="http://ccs.mit.edu/papers/CCSWP153.html">From Tabulators to Early Computers in the U.S. Life Insurance Industry</a> </table> <table class=fndef id="fndef:3"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:3">[3]</a> <td class=fndef-content ><a href="https://www.cio.com/article/3218667/have-you-had-your-bezos-moment-what-you-can-learn-from-amazon.html">Have you had your Bezos moment?
