# Mission

> JuliaActuary is focused on building packages that enable actuaries everywhere to build solutions using open-source tools.

The packages utilize all of the benefits of the [Julia language](https://julialang.org) and:

* provide easy access and clean interface to mortality tables (**MortalityTables.jl**)
* bundle a set of commonly used financial and math functions (**ActuaryUtiltities.jl**)
* provide an easy interface to many common life contingent maths (**LifeContingencies.jl**)

## Adding and Using Packages

There are two ways to add packages: 
- In the code itself: `using Pkg; Pkg.add("MortalityTables")`
- In the [REPL](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/index.html), hit `]` to enter Pkg mode and type `add MortalityTables`
More info can be found at the [Pkg manager documentation](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/getting-started).

To use packages in your code:

```julia
using PackageName
```

<!-- =============================
     MortalityTables
     ============================== -->
## MortalityTables.jl 

> Hassle-free mortality and other rate tables.


**Features**

- Lots of bundled SOA mort.soa.org tables
- `survival` and `decrement` functions to calculate decrements over period of time
- Partial year mortality calculations (Uniform, Constant, Balducci)
- Friendly syntax and flexible usage
- Extensive set of parametric mortality models.

**Quickstart**

Loading the package and bundled tables:

```julia-repl
julia> using MortalityTables

julia> tables = MortalityTables.tables()
Dict{String,MortalityTable} with 266 entries:
  "2015 VBT Female Non-Smoker RR90 ALB"                                       => SelectUltimateTable{OffsetArray{OffsetArray{Float64,1,Array{Float64,1}},1,Array{OffsetArray{Fâ€¦  
  "2017 Loaded CSO Preferred Structure Nonsmoker Preferred Female ANB"        => SelectUltimateTable{OffsetArray{OffsetArray{Float64,1,Array{Float64,1}},1,Array{OffsetArray{Fâ€¦  
  â‹®                                                                            => â‹®
```

Get information about a particular table:

```julia-repl
julia> vbt2001 = tables["2001 VBT Residual Standard Select and Ultimate - Male Nonsmoker, ANB"]
MortalityTable (Insured Lives Mortality):
   Name:
       2001 VBT Residual Standard Select and Ultimate - Male Nonsmoker, ANB
   Fields:
       (:select, :ultimate, :metadata)
   Provider:
       Society of Actuaries
   mort.SOA.org ID:
       1118
   mort.SOA.org link:
       https://mort.soa.org/ViewTable.aspx?&TableIdentity=1118
   Description:
       2001 Valuation Basic Table (VBT) Residual Standard Select and Ultimate Table -  Male Nonsmoker.
       Basis: Age Nearest Birthday. 
       Minimum Select Age: 0. 
       Maximum Select Age: 99. 
       Minimum Ultimate Age: 25. 
       Maximum Ultimate Age: 120
```

The package revolves around easy-to-access vectors which are indexed by attained age:

```julia-repl
julia> vbt2001.select[35] # vector of rates for issue age 35
 0.00036
 0.00048
 â‹®
 0.94729
 1.0

julia> vbt2001.select[35][35] #issue age 35, attained age 35
 0.00036

julia> vbt2001.ultimate[95]  # ultimate vectors only need to be called with the attained age
 0.24298
```

Calculate the force of mortality or survival over a range of time:

```julia
julia> survival(vbt2001.ultimate,30,40) # the survival between ages 30 and 40
0.9894404665434904

julia> decrement(vbt2001.ultimate,30,40) # the decrement between ages 30 and 40
0.010559533456509618
```

**Parametric Models**

Over 20 different models included. Example with the `Gompertz` model

```julia
m = MortalityTables.Gompertz(a=0.01,b=0.2)

m[20]                 # the mortality rate at age 20
decrement(m,20,25)    # the five year cumulative mortality rate
survival(m,20,25) # the five year survival rate
```

<!-- =============================
     ActuaryUtilities
    ============================== -->

## ActuaryUtilities.jl

> A collection of common functions/manipulations used in Actuarial Calculations.


Some of the functions included:

- `duration`:
  - Calculate the duration given an issue date and date (a.k.a. policy duration)
  - Calculate the `Macaulay`, `Modified`, or `DV01` durations for a set of cashflows
- `convexity` for price sensitivity
- `present_value` or `pv` to calculate the present value of a set of cashflows
- `discount_rate` for a given fixed rate or `InterestCurve`
- `internal_rate_of_return` or `irr` to calculate the IRR given cashflows (including at timepoints like Excel's `XIRR`)
- `breakeven` to calculate the breakeven time for a set of cashflows
- `accum_offset` to calculate accumulations like survival from a mortality vector

<!-- =============================
     LifeContingencies
    ============================== -->

## LifeContingencies.jl

> Common life contingent calculations with a convenient interface.

**Benefits**

- Integration with other JuliaActuary packages such as [MortalityTables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaActuary/MortalityTables.jl)
- Fast calculations, with some parts utilizing parallel processing power automatically
- Use functions that look more like the math you are used to (e.g. `A`, `aÌˆ`) with [Unicode support](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/unicode-input/index.html)
- All of the power, speed, convenience, tooling, and ecosystem of Julia
- Flexible and modular modeling approach

**Package Overview**

- Leverages [MortalityTables.jl](https://github.com/JuliaActuary/MortalityTables.jl) for the mortality calculations
- Contains common insurance calculations such as:
    - `A(life)`: Whole life
    - `A(life,n)`: Term life for `n` years
    - `aÌˆ(life)`: Life contingent annuity due
    - `aÌˆ(life,n)`: Life contingent annuity due for `n` years
- Contains various commutation functions such as `D(x)`,`M(x)`,`C(x)`, etc.
- `SingleLife` and `JointLife` capable
- Various interest rate mechanics (e.g. stochastic, constant, etc.)
- More documentation available by clicking the DOCS badges at the top of this README

**Quickstart**

Calculate various items for a 30-year-old male nonsmoker using 2015 VBT base table and a 5% interest rate

```julia
using LifeContingencies, MortalityTables

tbls = MortalityTables.tables()
vbt2001 = tbls["2001 VBT Residual Standard Select and Ultimate - Male Nonsmoker, ANB"]
age = 30
life = SingleLife(
    mort = vbt2001.select[age],
    issue_age = age
)

lc = LifeContingency(
    life,
    InterestRate(0.05)
)


A(lc)        # Whole Life insurance
A(lc,10)     # 10 year term insurance
P(lc)        # Net whole life premium 
V(lc,5)      # Net premium reserve for whole life insurance at time 5
aÌˆ(lc)        # Whole life annuity due
aÌˆ(lc, 5)     # 5 year annuity due
...          # and more!
```

### Actuarial Usage and Examples

#### Documentation

Each package includes examples on the Github site and in the documentation.

#### Walkthroughs and tutorials 
Coming soon!

#### Miscellaneous

- [Interactive exploration](/tutorials/PlutoESG) of the AAA's Economic Scenario Generator
- [Universal Life Policy Account Mechanics as a Differential Equation](/tutorials/PolicyDiffEq)

#### Help mode

You can also access help text when using the packages in the REPL by [activating help mode](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/REPL/index.html#Help-mode-1), e.g.:

```julia-repl
julia> ? survival
    survival(mortality_vector,to_age)
    survival(mortality_vector,from_age,to_age)


  Returns the survival through attained age to_age. The start of the 
  calculation is either the start of the vector, or attained age `from_age` 
  and `to_age` need to be Integers. 

  Add a DeathDistribution as the last argument to handle floating point 
  and non-whole ages:

    survival(mortality_vector,to_age,::DeathDistribution)
    survival(mortality_vector,from_age,to_age,::DeathDistribution)


  If given a negative to_age, it will return 1.0. Aside from simplifying the code, 
  this makes sense as for something to exist in order to decrement in the first place, 
  it must have existed and surived to the point of being able to be decremented.

  Examples
  â‰¡â‰¡â‰¡â‰¡â‰¡â‰¡â‰¡â‰¡â‰¡â‰¡

  julia> qs = UltimateMortality([0.1,0.3,0.6,1]);

  julia> survival(qs,0)
  1.0
  julia> survival(qs,1)
  0.9

  julia> survival(qs,1,1)
  1.0
  julia> survival(qs,1,2)
  0.7

  julia> survival(qs,0.5,Uniform())
  0.95
```

## Integration with R and Python

Julia integrates with other languages, allowing you to leverage existing scripts and packages in R via [RCall](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl) and in Python  via [PyCall](https://github.com/JuliaPy/PyCall.jl).
